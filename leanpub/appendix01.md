# WebService::Leanpub (module)

The module WebService::Leanpub allows the use of the Leanpub API from within
Perl to generate previews of your books, publish your books and query your
sales data.

This module uses an object-oriented interface. That means, you generate one
object which is tied to your book and authorized with your API key and then
access the different functions provided by the Leanpub API.

The following text is taken from the original documentation of the module.
