# Preface

After reading the
[notice in Google groups](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leanpub/CMfgZg4_ttw/z2j6cxoscmIJ)
from Scott Patten about the Leanpub
API, my first thought was: I want to use this with perl.

And then I wrote the perl module.

This book may be used as additional documentation to the perl module.

But it's main purpose is to test the Perl binding of the Leanpub API.
